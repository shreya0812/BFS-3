// Time Complexity: O(V + E) We traverse each node (V) and its edges (E) exactly once.
// Space Complexity: O(V) HashMap to store the mapping of original to cloned nodes.
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode: Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this: No

// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach:
// We use a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal to clone the graph.
// A HashMap is used to store the already cloned nodes to avoid revisiting and to handle cycles.
// For each node, we clone it if it hasn't been cloned yet and then recurse on its neighbors.
// After recursion, we add the cloned neighbors to the current nodeâ€™s clone.
